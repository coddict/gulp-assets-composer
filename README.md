## Usage

_TODO_

## Tests

To run the tests, do the following:

1. While not ideal, our tests currently depend on you having `gulp` install globally, which you can do using `npm install -g gulp`
2. Make sure you have run `npm install` in the repository
3. Then to run the tests, simply do `npm run test`, and the tests should run :)
